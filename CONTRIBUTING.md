Below you'll find...

When the siren's flash is gone
And we're left to carry on
All the memories are too few
When the pastor's music plays
And that casket rolls away
I could live again if you
Just stay alive for me
Please stay now, you left me here alone - it's the end of the line
Please stay I can't make it on my own - it's the end of the line
Make it on my own
It's the end of the line
Now that you are dead and gone
And I'm left to carry on
I could never smile cause you
Won't stay alive for me
